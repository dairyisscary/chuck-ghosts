Ghosts! - A Genetic, Neural Network Approach
================================

This is the code for a player that uses mini-max, a neural-network, and genetic weights. The three modules should be fairly easy to use on their own or together. The code is fairly well documented in the source code, but if you're planning a genetic approach in any way, you'll need to run your own tournament to make some good genes. Good luck and have fun!
