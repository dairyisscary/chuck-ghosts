Ghosts! - A Genetic, Neural Network Approach
-------------------------
This is the code for a player that uses mini-max (chuck.cc), a neural-network (neuralnet.cc), and genetic weights/evolution (genetics.cc). The three modules should be fairly easy to use on their own or together. The code is fairly well documented in the source, but if you're planning a genetic approach in any way, you'll need to run your own tournament to produce some good initial genes. Good luck and have fun!
